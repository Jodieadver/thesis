数据匹配

### **Automated data integration/ontology matching via LLMs or RAG architectures.**

Different datasets offer different perspectives. Put together, they can generate new insights. For instance, by combining an occurrence dataset of species and their occurrences in certain geographical locations with a dataset on location soil types, we can discover outliers: species that normally thrive under certain soil types, but suddenly seem to thrive in other soil types as well. The challenge here is to automatically suggest mappings between distinct data models for data integration. Similarly, different databases could use different ways to model specimen data. Could we automatically create mappings between these data models to facilitate data integration?

数据匹配

A recent development is the use of LLMs to allow databases to query over unstructured data [2,3,4]. Recent work has proposed the ability to query over LLMs treating their parameters as data sources [1,4].  This work often uses classical approaches to query planning and query optimisation bending them to fit LLMs as databases. In this project, we will investigate whether LLMs can substitute these query optimisation procedures and the trade-offs involved.
