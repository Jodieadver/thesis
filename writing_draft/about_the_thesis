### **Automated data integration/ontology matching via LLMs or RAG architectures.**

Different datasets offer different perspectives. Put together, they can generate new insights. For instance, by combining an occurrence dataset of species and their occurrences in certain geographical locations with a dataset on location soil types, we can discover outliers: species that normally thrive under certain soil types, but suddenly seem to thrive in other soil types as well. The challenge here is to automatically suggest mappings between distinct data models for data integration. Similarly, different databases could use different ways to model specimen data. Could we automatically create mappings between these data models to facilitate data integration?

匹配不同ontology的概念,这个部分已经有了研究, 比如说LLMsOM
我想做的研究是把前面不同数据集不同格式用LLM或者RAG做归一化处理

LLMs4OM is targeted to match different ontology of datasets. Different datasets have their different way of representing data, for example owl, xml. In this papeer, it is manully match all heterogeneous data which reuqires domain knowledge.

In this paper, we try to find a way using LLM or RAG architecture to automatically do ontology matching, faliciting data integration.
