In this section,we provide background on large language models(LLMs) and RAG which is the center of our work. 

2.1 LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL
LLM is a machine learning model trained on a self-supervised task. It has the ability to do in-context learning, which is solving new tasks without updating any model parameters. 

2.2 PROMPT ENGINEERING
Use natural language to elicit a particular generation for a specific kind of task.

xxxxxxx has become general principle of promt engineering.
